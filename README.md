A Console App in .NET that make requests to PokeAPI and draws Pokemons with ASCII characters on the terminal window characters with some information.

It has three branches, this one, the Master branch, has the application displaying the Pokemons on the terminal window with colors.
The ImageInBrowser branch opens the default browser configured on the machine's default OP system.

Lately, and most importantly, the AscciArtBlackAndWhite branch is the most complete one, displaying the Pokemons in Black and White, and handling the input of the user in order to mitigate unnecessary requests to the PokeAPI.
